# 🎓 Education
- Software University - Professional degree in Software Engineering
- School - Second English Language High School "Thomas Jefferson"

# 💻 Work
- I participated a couple times as a member of the SEC in the elections in my country.
It is not tech related experience but there was a lot of team work and problem solving envolved in the process.

# 🚀 Projects
- 💬 **Chatty** - This app was developed as part of my exam project at SoftUni. It features a fully functional back-end implemented with Node.js and a dynamic front-end built with React. It is based on a chat application. It allows logged-in users to chat with other users on the platform seemlessly with light and dark themes and the option to change your profile picture. - https://github.com/nikolay508/MERN-Real-Time-Chat-App <br><br> 
- 🇧🇬 **Guía Turística: Bulgaria** - This project is dedicated to showcase Bulgaria, a country often overlooked but rich in history, culture, and beauty. Created for a Spanish class, the content is entirely in Spanish, serving both an academic purpose and a broader educational goal: to introduce more people to the wonders of this magnificent country. - https://github.com/nikolay508/Guia-turistica-Bulgaria <br><br> 
- 🏈 **School Activities** - I created this site for my exam at SoftUni. It has back-end and front-end part. The back-end is made with NodeJS and the front-end is made with Angular. It stores activities made by the logged-in users. Every logged-in user can sign for an activity and if he wants to find a specific one he can do so with the search feature. - https://github.com/nikolay508/SoftUni-Angular-Exam <br><br>
