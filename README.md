# 🎓 Education
- Software University - Professional degree in Software Engineering
- School - Second English Language High School "Thomas Jefferson"

# 💻 Work
- I participated a couple times as a member of the SEC in the elections in my country.
It is not tech related but there was a lot of team work and problem solving envolved in the process.

# 🚀 Projects
- 🌐 **AI Chatbot** - This project is a chatbot with which you can chat just like any other Artificial Intelligence chatbot. It is made with JavaScript, HTML, CSS. It is using the Gemini API from Google. You can ask him any question and he will respond in seconds. - https://github.com/nikolay508/AI-Chatbot <br><br> 
- 🏈 **School Activities** - I created this site for my exam at SoftUni. It has back-end and front-end part. The back-end is made with NodeJS and the front-end is made with Angular. It stores activities made by the logged-in users. Every logged-in user can sign for an activity and if he wants to find a specific one he can do so with the search feature. - https://github.com/nikolay508/SoftUni-Angular-Exam <br><br> 
- 👨🏼‍💻 **Personal Site** -Created the project based on myself using client-side rendering. Implemented with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It is not fully developed yet but the idea is that every user could look up my work, my experience, education and being able to contact me more easily with a well-made site. - https://github.com/nikolay508/Personal-Website-2
